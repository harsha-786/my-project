# 1. Import the necessary libraries
import requests
import os # Often useful for handling environment variables for API keys

# 2. Set up your API key and the city you want to check
# It's better practice to load this from an environment variable, but for now, we'll put it here.
# IMPORTANT: Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with the key you copied.

# The f-string lets us easily embed our variables into the URL string.

    # The response from the API is in a format called JSON. 
    # The .json() method converts this text into a Python dictionary.
    data = response.json()

    # 6. Extract and display the relevant information
